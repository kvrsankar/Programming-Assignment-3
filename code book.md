# This code flow is as follows
  ## Defining the directories and file
  ## loading raw data into variables
   ## Mergeing the training and the test sets to create one data set
    ### Binding sensor data
    ### Label columns
  ## Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  ## Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  ## Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive names
  ## Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
